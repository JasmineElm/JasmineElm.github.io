Python [3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/) has been
out for a couple of months now, and I'm keen to try it out.  Not only is it
reportedly [faster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLhRuZ9cJWc), but it also
includes [Tomllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/toml.html) which is
something I want to use for life-logging scripts I'm working on for my
[zettelkasten](2020-05-29-keeping_a_journal_in_vim.md).


There's no direct way to install this via apt in Bullseye, so I've two options:
use a virtual environment, or install from source.

I could, of course, use Conda (and have done so on my laptop), but the machine
I'm going to install onto has more limited resources.  I'm using a [server](https://www.ionos.co.uk/servers/vps) with a single core, and mighty gigabyte of memory,
and 8 GB of diskspace, so running a full-blown Conda environment is likely to be
problematic.  Miniconda
[suggests](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) it needs 400 meg to
download and install alone.  Once I start creating environments, I'm likely to
outgrow my vps.  So I'm going to install Python 3.11 from source.

Thankfully, the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/) has
all the resources I need, so the installation is a fairly straightforward case
of issuing a few commands.

First, I need to install the dependencies:

+ software-properties-common 
+ wget 
+ pkg-config


```shell
sudo apt install software-properties-common wget pkg-config
```

Then, for the download, unpacking and installation I'll create a temporary directory

```shell
mkdir -p ~/scratch
cd ~/scratch
```

From there, it's simply a case of downloading and unpacking:

```shell
## find latest version at https://www.python.org/downloads/source/
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/Python-3.11.0.tar.xz
tar -xf Python-3.11.0.tar.xz
cd Python-3.11.0
```
and finally installing:
```shell
## configure and install
./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make altinstall
```

You can check the installation by running `python3.11 --version`:

```shell
python3.11 --version

```
which should return `Python 3.11.0`

alternative install means that the new
version is installed as `python3.11` rather than `python3`, so you can run both
the original version and the new one side-by-side.  this should mean that the
installation doesn't break any existing scripts.  As my machine doesn't have any
python2, I decided to use `update-alternatives` to make `python` point to the
new `python3.11`:

```shell
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.11 1
```

That step's optional, and certainly not for everyone, but it means that I can
run `python3.11` by simply typing `python` at the command line - perfect for my
lazy fingers.
