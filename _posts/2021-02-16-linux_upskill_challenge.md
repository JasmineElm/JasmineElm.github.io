With the pandemic, there have been loads of courses that have been made [temporarily free](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREECoursesEveryday/).  It can be difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff; video courses are better than grinding through dense documentation, but not [as effective as practise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_pyramid).  Enter the [Linux Upskill Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxupskillchallenge/).  The challenge is a good mix of clear instructions and community support that gives a good grounding in Linux Sysadmin.

As a linux user, there was a temptation to simply use my own machine.  This however runs contrary to the spirit of the challenge.  Instead, creating and maintaining a virtual private server gives a far more authentic experience of Linux System Administration.  Although it's the first day, I have found the experience of setting up an `ec2` instance on AWS invaluable.

I'm keeping a repo of my notes [here](https://github.com/JasmineElm/Linux_Upskill_Challenge) The repo also includes a simple script to manage ec2 instances straight from the commandline rather than use the the web interface.
