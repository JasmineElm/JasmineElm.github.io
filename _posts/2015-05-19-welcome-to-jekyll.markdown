synopsis: "First Post"

This is my first post, it'll be likely deleted once I figure stuff out, particularly once I get my head around [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [textile](http://redcloth.org/textile).  The site is hosted on Github, so my amateur code is easily viewed under my profile.

Things to do include (but are not limited to)

+ create logo
+ create icons for
  + text
  + images
  + sound, and
  + code
+ create a blurb
+ do a couple of fancy things with javascript (display random images using ```random *math.floor``` and string concatenation)
+ some whizzy jQuery to filter posts by category
