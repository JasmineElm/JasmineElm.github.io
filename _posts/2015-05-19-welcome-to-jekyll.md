This is my first post, it'll be likely deleted once I figure stuff out, particularly once I get my head around [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [textile](http://redcloth.org/textile).  The site is hosted on Github, so my amateur code is easily viewed under my profile.

Things to do include (but are not limited to)

- create logo
- create icons for
  - text
  - images
  - sound, and
  - code
- create a blurb
- do a couple of fancy things with javascript (display random images using `random *math.floor` and string concatenation)
- some whizzy jQuery to filter posts by category
