Here is a research paper I wrote on the effects (or not) of a randomise function on the timing of midi files.  Algorithmic art is an interest of mine, so I wanted to explore whether humanize functions add anything to a rendering of a piece of music.  Whilst the results suggest that the chosen parameters either added nothing, or were not detectable to the majority of listeners, there is a rich seam of research that could be carried out into closing the gap between computerised composition and performance.
